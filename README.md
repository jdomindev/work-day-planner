# <Work-Day-Planner>
## Description
- This project involved creating a work day scheduler.
- This scheduler helped me to create my html dynamically through using mostly only jquery and bootstrap. It gave me good practice using both of those tools as well as more practice using local storage. This project also gave me my first look into using the moment library for setting date and time.
